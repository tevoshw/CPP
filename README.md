# 🚀 C++ for Machine Learning and Programming Fundamentals

This repository was created with the goal of **learning C++ from scratch to a solid level**, focusing on:
- Building a **strong programming foundation**
- Understanding **low-level concepts**
- Preparing for **Machine Learning, Data Science, and high-performance systems**

Studying C++ helps to better understand how things work *under the hood*, which is extremely valuable for anyone aiming to work with **ML, AI, performance optimization, and software engineering**.
